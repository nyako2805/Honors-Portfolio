        <h3>Autumn Quarter Reflection </h3>
          <p>Since joining the University of Washington Honors Community, the Honors Program has gone above and beyond my expectations.
          The focus on an Interdisciplinary education has allowed me to see the possibilities that lie within my intended major, and to 
          look beyond what I had initially intended for myself.  When first coming to the University of Washington, I had wanted to focus 
          my studies in computer science on game design; however, the resources afforded me by the Honors program have allowed me to find 
          my calling instead in data visualization, something I had very little experience with prior to my attendance at the University 
          of Washington.</p>
