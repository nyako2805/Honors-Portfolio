      <h3>Autumn Quarter Reflection </h3>
        <p>Since joining the University of Washington Honors Community, the Honors Program has gone above and beyond my expectations. 
          When first coming to the University of Washington, I had wanted to focus my studies in computer science on game design.  
          However, the opportunities within the Honors Program have encouraged me to seek out new opportunities, and I am now interested 
          in focusing on data visualization. I hope that the Honors Program will add depth to my education by encouraging me to apply
          data visualization to topics that matter to me.  TODO: Some closing sentence about how I can't wait to see what the future 
          holds for me. </p>
      <h3>Robotics </h3>
          <p>Joining the University of Washington's Advanced Robotics team has allowed me to see the possibilities that lie within
          the field of computer science for me at the University of Washington. My time on the team as the leader of the Simulation Team
          has allowed me to see the power of collaboration. This opportunity has allowed me to strengthen my leadership skills, as 
          well as hone my technical abilities. </p>
