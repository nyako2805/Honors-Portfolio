        <h3>Autumn Quarter Reflection </h3>
          <p>Since joining the University of Washington Honors Community, the Honors Program has gone above and beyond my expectations. 
            When first coming to the University of Washington, I had wanted to focus my studies in computer science on game design.  
            However, the opportunities within the Honors Program have encouraged me to seek out new opportunities, and I am now interested 
            in focusing on data visualization. I hope that the Honors Program will add depth to my education by encouraging me to apply
            data visualization to topics that matter to me.  Now, I can't wait to see what the future holds for me. </p>

        <h3>Advanced Robotics at the University of Washington</h3>
            <p>Joining the University of Washington's Advanced Robotics team has allowed me to see the possibilities that lie within
            the field of computer science for me at the University of Washington. My time on the team as the leader of the Simulation Team
            has allowed me to see the power of collaboration. This opportunity has allowed me to strengthen my leadership skills, as 
            well as hone my technical abilities. This artifact is a 3D model that I created in Autodesk Inventor. I had initially 
            thought that this model was too complicated for me to create, but thanks to the help of my peers, I was able to finish
            it.</p>

        <h3>Math 124</h3>
            <p>Math 124 was by far my most difficult class this quarter. I had taken calculus in high school and had expected calculus
            in college to be similar to what I had been doing then. However, the problems I worked on were far more difficult than 
            the ones I tackled in high school. This problem took me two hours of work to complete, but the feeling of accomplishment 
            I experienced after I was done with this one problem was far greater than the accomplishment I'd feel after completing a 
            full assignment in high school.</p>

         <h3>CSE 390</h3>
            <p>CSE 390 has allowed me to see the possibilities that lie within computer science. In the class, I was exposed interesting 
            computer science topics, such as public key cryptography and pagerank. These ultimately led to me considering a change in 
            my career goals, as I am now considering a career in data visualization rather than game design. Additionally, this class
            gave me the skills and inspired me to code my Honors Portfolio on my own, rather than use a site to design it for me.</p>
